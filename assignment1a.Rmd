## Why are you taking this course?
### I am taking this course because I want to leave Bren with some R still in my wheelhouse. As of now my last substantial experience with R was in 206 and I need a refresher. 

## Data Science Background
### My data science background is limited to 206 and other Bren courses. I was a math minor in undergrad but that was a far cry from data science and using compSci to understand large data sets

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
